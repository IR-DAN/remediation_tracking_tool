# DCSO Remediation Tracking Tool

### An Excel based tool to track the progress of a remediation project/program

The DCSO Remediation Tracking Tool was developed during large scale security incidents to track remediation
project/program milestones and progress. It enables quick information gathering and transparent
global communication across different time zones during complex projects/programs, reducing the
number of status calls significantly.

The Excel based tool integrates Outlook to create and send emails, containing the current status and
links for the recipients to respond with a new status or an issue.

Using the customizable dashboard, it enables visualization of the progress in almost real-time, supporting
managerial decisions and steering of remediation measures.

To operate the tool, Microsoft Office is required (VBA-Macro enabled Excel and Outlook).

For out-of-band communication, a cloud hosted email-provider (e.g. Office365) can be used to avoid
communication on compromised infrastructure.
